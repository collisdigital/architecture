# Authentication for emergency department


**Status**: Experiment by IGDC-DHCW + draft + work in progress + request for comments

**Date**: 2025-03-24

**Governance**: IGDC-DHCW for the time being


## Situation - Context and Problem Statement

We are developing a hospital emergency department software application, and we are learning that some kinds of authentication are not viable e.g. sending the doctor an SMS text, or using a TOPT authenticator app on a nurse's mobile phone.

This is a work in progress (WIP) and a request for comments (RFC).

We welcome constructive advice, constructive criticism, pointers to resources, and help.

## Background - Decision Drivers

High-level purpose:

- We need multi-factor authentication because the data includes high-security healthcare records.

- We want speed because some emergency department patients have life-threatening critical issues.

- We want convenience because the clinical staff has so much things happening at once.

### Challenges

The hospital emergency department setting has challenges that are different than in most settings.

For example, we're discovering challenges related to mobile phone text/app authentication, mobile phone camera authentication, and touchscreen interfaces.


### Can we rely on mobile phone text/app authentication?

No. We cannot rely on every person having sufficient access to their personal phones.

  - Some hospital administrators disallow personal phones for professional use.

  - Some people have phones that are somewhat broken, such as with broken glass, which could introduce a safety risk in an emergengy department setting.

  - Some hospital staff store their personal phones in their work lockers, because they prefer to separate their personal life and professional life.

  - Some triage staff do not want to expose their personal phones to any extra infection vectors, such as microbes in the emergency department.

  - Some staff are reasonably concerned about accidentally damaging their phone, such as dropping it.

  - Some healthcare professionals assert increased risk of microbial infection when consumer-grade phones are used in hospital-grade settings, because the phones cannot be easily wiped or disinfected.

  - Some EHR representatives assert increased risk of accidents with personal mobile phones.

  - Some providers do not want to carry their phones with them, because they are moving frequently among hospital areas that are dangerous for mobile phones, such as near MRI machines.

  - Some hospitals have mobile coverage issues, because of subpar coverage by the local cellular company, or subpar coverage by the local wifi network, or signal interference by building structures or medical equipment.

  - Some staff describe battery issues, such as their battery not lasting a full workday during normal use.


### Can we rely on mobile phone camera authentication?

Maybe. Probably, if the camera is for purpose. Probably not, if the camera is for generic use such as on a mobile phone.

  - Example: A provider tries to use their personal mobile phone that has their installed EHR mobile app, which has a secure camera function. Unfortunately, the doctor accidentally uses the built-in camera app. This accidentally causes a PII leak (because the patient photo is now on the provider's personal photo stream) and additionally causes a loss of information (because the patient photo is not saved into the EHR).

  - Example: A provider sees something about the patient and wants a second opinion from a peer or supervisor. The provider asks the patient ahead of time if it's OK to take a photo using the doctor's own personal phone camera, and explains to the patient that the purpose is to work around an EHR limitation in photo sharing. A typical example is a doctor who wants to get a second opinion from a colleage at a different health organization that uses a non-compatible EHR. This is all done fully transparently, and fully in the interests of helping the patient. However, the image never goes into either provider's EHR. Worse, some providers send the images via insecure messaging systems, or corporate social networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp.

  - Example: A provider surreptitiously takes a photo for selfish reasons, such as photograhping a celebrity without their consent.


### Can we rely on fingerprint authentication?

No. We don't see any viable path forward for requiring fingerprints.

  - Example: a provider wears nitrile gloves, which obscure fingerprints.

  - Example: a provider gets their fingers wet, such as with body fluids, or with wash disinfectants.


### Can we rely on touchscreen interfaces?

Maybe. Probably yes if we try to use a medical-grade disinfectable large touchscreen. Probably no if we try to use a personal phone.

  - Example: A provider tries to use a touchscreen while wearing personal protective gear, such as latex gloves or nitrile gloves. Unfortunately, the gloves interfere with the touch screen. Additionally, the gloves may leave behind dust on the screen, which then interferes even more.

  - Example: for shared touchscreens, such as those used in emergency departments, many providers touch the screen throughout the day. This can cause increased risk of cross-contamination, infection, microbial spread, and grime. In some medical settings, there are standard operating proceedures for wiping screens and disinfecting screens, such as every hour, or between uses by each staff person, or between each patient interaction.


## Assessment - Considered Options

We aim to create good-enough security, good-enough speed, and good-enough convenience.

We are currently investigating many options.


### Touchless chips

There are options for touchless chipces, such as by using a touchless smartcard (or wristband, or ring, etc.) that use radio-frequency identification (RFID) and/or near field communication (NFC).

These can be used with many kinds of implementations, such as an RFID chip on a physcial ID card, or an NFC interaction by using a phone or smartwatch, etc.


### FIDO2, WebAuthn CTAP2

Newer protocols such as FIDO2 with WebAuthn and CTAP2 offer possibilities to go passwordless. A FIDO2 security key looks like a promising path.


### Professional mobile phones

Could the hospital provide each staff member with a professional mobile phone? This could be a highly-durable phone, with a drop-proof water-proof case, and with hospital-specific multi-device management software.

There are expenses for this.

This option does not seem to address the problems with areas near MRI machines, nor sub-par coverage.


### Touchscreen kiosks/devices

Could the hospital provide a medical-grade large touchscreen, such as 15-inch or larger, such as on a medical cart?

There are commercial options for self-contained computers with medical-grade large touchscreens, that have multiple large-capacity battery packs that can be swapped in and out as needed, for 24-hour power without needing any wall outlet.

There are commercial options for rapid disinfectable screens, including with dedicated physical buttons to lock the screen, so wiping the screen doesn't accidentally cause any interface touch events.


### Microsoft Windows Hello

Microsoft Windows Hello is "a more personal way to sign in, using your face, fingerprint or a PIN. You can use Windows Hello to sign in to your device from the lock screen and sign in to your account on the web."

There are some issues with face recognition if the provider is wearing a face mask. These issues may be simple or complex to overcome, depending on whether the software is able to do a sufficiently-expert recognition of the person's eye area and 3D facial structure.

There may be some issues with how many different people can use one Microsoft Windows Hello sign in, on some devices. One of our security consulting partners has said that they hit limits at 10 users of the same machine.

We believe there are similar kinds of camera-based authentication systems for other operating systems and devices. A common request is to ensure that whatever system we develop is also conceptually viable to work on a typical iPad and a typical Android tablet.


### Biometric sign in beyond face and fingerprints

There are potential options for biometric sign in beyond face and fingerprints: voice recognition, hand recognition, retina recognition. We may research these.
